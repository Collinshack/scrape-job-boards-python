Working in brain injury rehabilitation is different to other kinds of support work. You’re there to encourage and guide individuals, helping them gain the skills and confidence to live independently.
  
  

You will share the journey with these inspiring people as they overcome hurdles, achieve milestones, and reach the goals they’ve set. You can make a massive difference in that time.
  
  

Why join us?
  
  

Brainkind is a charity that aims to improve the lives of people with brain injuries in the UK. Our assessment centres, rehabilitation units and hospitals use expert neurorehabilitation to support people to regain the skills they have lost. We treat people with a range of brain injuries – sustained through trauma, illness, substance abuse and more – to recover and meet their personal goals. Our employees are incredibly passionate about the jobs they do – you’ll find a strong team spirit across our services and amazing colleagues who always pull together and look out for each other.
  
  

The Role
  
  

Mill Street, opened in Spring 2021, is a purpose-built supported living service for people with acquired brain injury, physical disabilities and/or sensory impairment. There are 13 self-contained flats available. The service is managed by a Registered Service Manager Nicola, who leads Team Leaders and team of Support Workers to deliver a service of exceptional quality. It is a really varied job, with all kinds of different activities to organise and participate in.
  
  

Mill Street is a permanent home for the people we support, and our focus is to support people to live the way they wish to, and be fully included in all aspects of their lives. We actively promote independence, and encourage community integration, whilst supporting with daily tasks such as providing personal care, environmental management, supporting with medication, health appointments, meal preparation and cooking to name a few.
  
  

You’ll get huge job satisfaction from seeing the people you are supporting do more for themselves and live the life they want to live. If you’re interested in building a career, we’re here to support you all the way on your own journey.
  
  

About you
  
  

We’re not looking for any kind of specific experience. It is your personality and values that will make you a good fit for the role and our Charity. We can train and develop you to become a great Community Support Worker if you:

You’ll join a supportive team, that’ll provide all the training and development you need to support your client, helping you get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**Your role**
Everyone is different. That’s the simple truth at the core of our approach to care. And the care opportunities we offer are different, too, from taking clients to medical appointments or helping them get up in the morning, to spending a full twelve hours helping them through their day. Whatever you choose, you’ll be there to look after that person’s unique needs.

What’s hugely important is your ability to build a connection with the people you’re caring for. And, of course, you’ll need to be able to handle the physical aspects, too. As part of the role, you will be required to have experience in the following:

* Tracheostomy
* Oral Suctioning
* Oxygen Therapy
* Nebulizer
* NG Tube


 If you have the patience and flexibility to meet people on their level, we’ll support you in providing the personal care they deserve.

**Supporting you**
Being a Sonderwell carer isn’t just about caring. It’s about being good with people, too – being able to gain the trust of clients and their families. That’s why, if you have a caring personality and some relevant experience, we’ll give you access to online and classroom training in specific complex care needs, as well as the chance to study for a relevant NVQ.

Depending on the client, you may be working on your own or part of a team. If you wish and have the availability, you could provide to support more than one client.

Before you start, you’ll have the chance to meet your client and their family. And when you do, you’ll have day-to-day support with a Care Co-ordinator or Nurse Manager always on hand to answer your questions. You’ll also be able to access our ‘Carer App’ which is a fantastic source of insight and information. In short, we’ll give you all you need to get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**What we can offer you**
Each of our clients has individual needs, so whether you’re looking for full-time or part-time hours, night shifts or day shifts, we can offer an opportunity to suit you. We’re continuously developing our benefits package to help you get more out of your role with Sonderwell. What’s more, if you recommend someone who joins us, you could also receive a referral payment. And our employee assistance programme means you’ll have access to support that is focused on your well-being.

As a Sonderwell Complex Care Assistant, you can make a real difference to people’s lives, by caring for their complex needs and enabling them to live the life they choose. You’ll join a supportive team, that’ll provide all the training and development you need to support your client, helping you get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**Your role**
Everyone is different. That’s the simple truth at the core of our approach to care. And the care opportunities we offer are different, too, from taking clients to medical appointments or helping them get up in the morning, to spending a full twelve hours helping them through their day. Whatever you choose, you’ll be there to look after that person’s unique needs.

What’s hugely important is your ability to build a connection with the people you’re caring for. And, of course, you’ll need to be able to handle the physical aspects, too. As part of the role, you will be required to have experience in the following:

* Challenging Behaviour
* Administration of medication


 If you have the patience and flexibility to meet people on their level, we’ll support you in providing the personal care they deserve.

**Supporting you**
Being a Sonderwell carer isn’t just about caring. It’s about being good with people, too – being able to gain the trust of clients and their families. That’s why, if you have a caring personality and some relevant experience, we’ll give you access to online and classroom training in specific complex care needs, as well as the chance to study for a relevant NVQ.

Depending on the client, you may be working on your own or part of a team. If you wish and have the availability, you could provide to support more than one client.

Before you start, you’ll have the chance to meet your client and their family. And when you do, you’ll have day-to-day support with a Care Co-ordinator or Nurse Manager always on hand to answer your questions. You’ll also be able to access our ‘Carer App’ which is a fantastic source of insight and information. In short, we’ll give you all you need to get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**What we can offer you**
Each of our clients has individual needs, so whether you’re looking for full-time or part-time hours, night shifts or day shifts, we can offer an opportunity to suit you. We’re continuously developing our benefits package to help you get more out of your role with Sonderwell. What’s more, if you recommend someone who joins us, you could also receive a referral payment. And our employee assistance programme means you’ll have access to support that is focused on your well-being.

**We are open to all**
We’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace where all employees feel valued, respected, and empowered. We believe that diversity in our workforce drives excellence, and we work hard to create an environment that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds and, where possible, we’ll provide accommodations for those applicants with disabilities.
