(Freelance | Flexible Schedule | Commission-Based)

**Location:** Manchester City – You must be based in Manchester or the surrounding area to apply.

**This role focuses exclusively on HMO properties for rental purposes only — not for buying or selling. Our properties are let to students and professionals.**

**About Us**

We are a growing property marketplace operating in key UK cities, including Manchester. Our work focuses on the long-term management of residential properties under company lets, specifically for co-living, student, and professional rental markets.

We collaborate directly with landlords and letting agents who hold residential portfolios and are open to flexible, high-occupancy property strategies. As we expand our coverage in Manchester, we are seeking **local representatives** who can open collaboration opportunities by **arranging property viewings** through letting agencies.

**The Role: What You’ll Be Doing**

As a **Local Property Partnership Representative**, your role is to act as the **first point of contact** between our company and letting agencies in Manchester. Your goal is to speak to agents, explain our company let model, and secure in-person property viewings for our internal team.

This is **not a sales or closing role**. You are not expected to attend the viewings or sign contracts — your job is to open doors, warm the lead, and trigger an actionable next step (viewing).

You will:

* Identify and contact letting agencies operating in Manchester (in person, by phone, or through local networks)
* Introduce our property management model and collaboration offer
* Secure **a confirmed property viewing appointment** with the letting agent
* Submit viewing details to our internal team for follow-up
* Receive payment once **3 or 5 verified viewings** have been completed through your outreach

**What You’re Offering Letting Agents**

* A professional, hands-off management model
* Guaranteed rent potential under company let
* Full property marketing, tenant placement, and management services
* A starting trial with one property (no long-term commitment required)

Agents you speak to are not being asked to sign anything or commit to a deal upfront — only to arrange a viewing with our internal property team which is a potential to work together. The viewings must be classified to serve the company let purpose (not just a general property tenant inquiry)

**What We’re Looking For**

This is **not an entry-level job or a learning opportunity**. We are only looking for individuals who are self-motivated, professional, and have the confidence to communicate with letting agents.

**You must be:**

* Based in Manchester and have knowledge of local property areas
* Confident speaking to professionals over the phone or in person
* Reliable, responsive, and able to follow up without supervision
* Interested in property, lettings, negotiation, or relationship-building
* Comfortable working independently and being paid per output (not per hour)

This role is ideal for:

* Individuals currently working in property or real estate
* People in flexible freelance roles looking for additional income
* Sales or business development professionals who enjoy local networking
* Ex-letting agents or property assistants with agency contacts

**Compensation & Payment Details**

**Compensation:**

* £250 per 3 verified property viewings arranged and completed
* £450 per 5 verified property viewings arranged and completed
* Payouts are made upon internal confirmation of viewings conducted via your outreach

This is a **freelance, output-based role.** You are paid in bundles based on completed results, not for calls or introductions.

* **Bundle 1:** £250 upon completion of 3 verified viewings arranged through your leads
* **Bundle 2:** £450 upon completion of 5 verified viewings
* Viewings are verified by our internal team through letting agent confirmation and attendance by our staff
* Payment is released within **5 working days** of verification or viewings done whichever comes first.

**You are not paid for:**

* Conversations without a confirmed viewing
* Verbal interest without agent follow-up
* Self-booked viewings not passed through our internal system
* Actual Viewing taken place
* Evidence of the above in writing from stakeholders.

**What Support You’ll Receive**

* A short onboarding call to align on goals and expectations
* A pitch outline and conversation framework
* Our branded intro PDF to send to letting agents
* A simple tracking sheet to log your activity

You will NOT be micromanaged. This is a high-trust role — we work with professionals who take initiative.

**Application Instructions**

**Please read carefully before applying.**

We are only accepting candidates who:

* Are based in Manchester
* Understand this is not a salaried position
* Have strong communication skills and local property knowledge
* Are serious about committing at least a few hours per week to this role

**To apply, please send the following to hr@thekarnani.com:**

* A brief cover letter or email (1–2 paragraphs) introducing yourself and explaining your connection to the Manchester property market
* Your CV or LinkedIn profile
* Optional: Any prior experience in letting agency work, property visits, or business development

This is a **results-based freelance position** for candidates who want to build local property relationships and earn supplementary income based on real, simple deliverables.

If you're confident you can start conversations, explain our value, and bring in verified viewings — we’d love to hear from you.

Are you an experienced marine consultant with a passion for leading and delivering high-quality environmental projects? Do you have a strong technical background in marine ecology assessments, including EIA, HRA, and WFD, and a desire to shape the future of a growing consultancy team? Have you got the leadership skills to mentor and develop others while driving business growth and expanding client relationships? We are looking for a skilled marine ecologist to join our marine consultancy team, playing a key role in delivering high-quality, innovative, strategic and specialist consultancy services to our clients.



As Principal Marine Consultant, you will lead on high-profile marine ecology projects, ensuring excellence in technical delivery. You will play a key role in managing tenders, interpreting ecological data for the purposes of impact assessment, liaising with key stakeholders, and producing and reviewing reporting outputs to contribute to the development of APEM Group’s capability and capacity in the marine sector.



Success in this role means taking an active leadership position, shaping business strategy, and expanding APEM’s marine ecology capabilities across the UK and beyond. You will have the opportunity to attend and present at conferences, engage with clients and stakeholders, and drive new business opportunities while maintaining the highest technical standards. You will apply your knowledge of marine benthic species and habitats, combined with a deep understanding of environmental legislation and assessments, to oversee and quality-assure outputs while mentoring and developing the team. Your ability to manage projects, balance financial considerations, and oversee a team of consultants will be key to driving continued growth and success.

A background in business development, client engagement, and stakeholder management—including working with statutory nature conservation bodies—is essential, as is experience managing large-scale projects with financial oversight. Strong report writing and technical review skills are crucial. Ideally, you will have an MSc (or higher) in an environmental or ecological subject, experience coordinating full marine EIAs and a range of different types of ecological assessments. Previous line management experience, membership of a relevant professional institute, knowledge of statistical analysis software such as PRIMER and GIS skills are also desirable.



You will be offered the chance to work on a variety of projects, many of our employees have worked on projects that have been of personal interest to them. We match this with a commitment to continuous development and learning to support your career. We also offer benefits to look after you, from private medical insurance for all employees, access to mental health first aiders and comprehensive income protection if you cannot work. We also offer superb flexible working options, balancing work with your life.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive team. If you can’t tick every box on our job description, then we are still keen to hear from you and are open to supporting your development. That may be working part time or supporting you to gain experience in a specific area – we are a growing company and are able to adapt roles to reflect individual skills.
