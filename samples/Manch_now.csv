**About The Company**


We are a family-run business providing quality residential care homes and support services to older people and those living with dementia.


We built our first residential care home in the early 1980s when we noticed that many care homes were set up in old converted buildings that didn’t always lend themselves to meeting the wide-ranging needs of those with age-related difficulties or dementia. We built the home brick by brick to create first-rate, safe and homely accommodation in a community setting.


Since those early days, we have grown our business in order to meet the need for first-class, quality care and support for our ageing population. We now have four residential care homes for older people, Pendle Brook, Coniston House, Royley House and Bank Hall. We specialise in catering for the needs of those with dementia as well as offering a fantastic daycare service, flexible respite care facilities and a home care service providing support to people living independently in their own homes.

**Company Culture**


Exceptional care homes don’t stay special on their own. Our dedicated teams make sure every one of the people in our care has a great experience, every time. Our success relies on the professionalism, commitment and caring nature of each and every team member and we’re always looking for similar-minded people to join us.


We welcome applications from qualified and experienced professionals, as well as from those who are just starting out. We’re keen to open up new routes into jobs in the care sector, that’s why we’re continually growing the number and range of training opportunities we offer, helping individuals earn while they learn and contribute to the excellent care we provide.


Do great things for us and we’ll do great things for you and your career. Rochcare is an encouraging and supportive company, we provide a comprehensive induction and training programme for both those with experience and those who are just starting out.

**Company Benefits**


Rochcare offers a competitive salary and values the continuous hard work of our employees. As a family-owned and managed company, we believe our employees should be generously rewarded for their dedication to providing exceptional care. That is why we offer the following benefits and rewards.


Retirement plan and/or pension, Flexible schedule, Office perks, Employee development programs, Free parking, Referral bonus, Open office, Competitive salary, Long service recognition, Free parking or Discounted parking , Wellbeing Scheme, Blue Light Card, Social Opportunities, Employee of the Month, Employee Recognition Scheme

As a Sonderwell Complex Care Assistant, you can make a real difference to people’s lives, by caring for their complex needs and enabling them to live the life they choose. You’ll join a supportive team, that’ll provide all the training and development you need to support your client, helping you get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**Your role**
Everyone is different. That’s the simple truth at the core of our approach to care. And the care opportunities we offer are different, too, from taking clients to medical appointments or helping them get up in the morning, to spending a full twelve hours helping them through their day. Whatever you choose, you’ll be there to look after that person’s unique needs.

What’s hugely important is your ability to build a connection with the people you’re caring for. And, of course, you’ll need to be able to handle the physical aspects, too. As part of the role, you will be required to have experience in the following:

**Chest Physio**  

**Oxygen Therapy**  

**Peg Feeding**  

**Medication Administration**
**Nebulizer**  

**Oral Suctioning**

If you have the patience and flexibility to meet people on their level, we’ll support you in providing the personal care they deserve.

**Supporting you**
Being a Sonderwell carer isn’t just about caring. It’s about being good with people, too – being able to gain the trust of clients and their families. That’s why, if you have a caring personality and some relevant experience, we’ll give you access to online and classroom training in specific complex care needs, as well as the chance to study for a relevant NVQ.

Depending on the client, you may be working on your own or part of a team. If you wish and have the availability, you could provide to support more than one client.

Before you start, you’ll have the chance to meet your client and their family. And when you do, you’ll have day-to-day support with a Care Co-ordinator or Nurse Manager always on hand to answer your questions. You’ll also be able to access our ‘Carer App’ which is a fantastic source of insight and information. In short, we’ll give you all you need to get the most out of this rewarding and fulfilling role.

**What we can offer you**
Each of our clients has individual needs, so whether you’re looking for full-time or part-time hours, night shifts or day shifts, we can offer an opportunity to suit you. We’re continuously developing our benefits package to help you get more out of your role with Sonderwell. What’s more, if you recommend someone who joins us, you could also receive a referral payment. And our employee assistance programme means you’ll have access to support that is focused on your well-being.

**We are open to all**
We’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace where all employees feel valued, respected, and empowered. We believe that diversity in our workforce drives excellence, and we work hard to create an environment that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds and, where possible, we’ll provide accommodations for those applicants with disabilities.

Given the personal nature of intimate care, our clients are entitled to select their caregivers in these situations. The preferences of our clients do not represent the views of our organisation, which is committed to being an equal opportunity employer. We offer a diverse range of other positions.

Night Work

Location: Cannock

**Job description**

Assured Cleaning Services Ltd are pleased to be recruiting individuals to join our team of Extraction Cleaning and Maintenance Technicians.

**The Role**

Assured Cleaning Services Ltd have a team of Technicians whose role is to report on and manage the levels of grease within the kitchen extraction systems of our client’s restaurants.

The role involves visiting our client’s restaurants according to a planned schedule, as part of a team of Technicians. On each visit you will:

* Conduct a deep clean of the kitchen extraction system
* This involves scraping and removing grease from the system. It is a dirty and physically demanding job. You will be required to shut down the extraction system at the start of your shift and then ensure it is fully functional again before leaving the client premises. The role involves working safely at height, manual handling and working safely with chemicals. Some parts of the extraction system will be located on roofs and outside, you will be required to work on these in all weather conditions.
* Produce a report for the client which details the condition of the extraction system both before and after the clean.
* Provide good customer service to our client.
* Work well as part of a team.
* Ensure that the Company vehicle is well looked after, with stock and equipment properly maintained.

**Working Hours/Pattern** 

This role involves predominantly night work. Occasional day work may be required - this would be agreed on an as and when basis. From time to time you may be required to work away from home.

You can expect to work 40 hours per week, Sunday through to Thursday. The exact hours of work each night will vary a little and you will need to be flexible to accommodate this. This is due to our client having varying closedown times across their restaurants, and because you will need to travel to different restaurant locations each night.

The salary on offer for this role is £25-27,000 per year.

**What you can expect from us**

Experience of this type of role is welcomed but not required. Full training will be given in the methods of grease extraction, how to carry out this work safely and how to compile the reports for our client. Extensive support is also given by our office to the teams who are out working at night. You will be given full PPE and all the equipment that you need to carry out the role.

This is an opportunity to join a growing team, which provides a service to a prestigious restaurant client.

Assured Cleaning Services Ltd are a family run company who have been in business for 22 years. We are fully insured and have been successfully working with our prestigious client for around 12 years and we look forward to meeting with potential Technicians who can help us to maintain and grow our excellent relationship with the client.
