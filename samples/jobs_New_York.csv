This is an OVERNIGHT POSITION for the hours of 5pm-630am 3 days a week (Wed-Fri). The start time is NOT flexible, my son has to be picked no later then 5pm from school, come 501 the school will charge a late fee if he's not picked up. So you have to be on time and have your own reliable transportation. Dinner time is 630, and bedtime is 930.

My son is not big on electronics, which is why I believe his imagination is so strong. The point of the job is to burn him out so he'll be tired for bedtime, once he's asleep your time is your own to do as you please.

When it comes to burning him out an unorthodox style is needed. You'll need to use reverse psychology as well as role play. You'll have to start a game on your own and use these styles to draw him in. Going in different rooms to talk to imaginary people, as well as VOICING that areas or activities are exclusively for you and no one else will get his attention making him want to join what ever it is your doing. That's when you'll be able to start burning him out. If you try calling him over or making it known you need his help to start a game then your attempt will fail. Just to be clear this style is only used for play time which is about 3hrs total but not consecutive.

When applying be sure to check your inbox the same day, I'll send you a message shortly after applying with further instructions.

**Overview**  

  

New York City Transit is looking for customer communicators with extensive social media experience to provide world class customer care for the millions of people we move each day. In this role, you will translate information about current subway and bus service received from multiple channels into customer-facing communications and publish it across multiple channels, including mta.info, the MTA app and third-party apps, @NYCTSubway and @NYCTBus on X (Twitter), and screens in subway stations and on buses.  

  

You will also provide best-in-class social customer care – monitoring in-take queues, determining the best response approach, and providing support to customers until you’ve helped them get where they need to go, resolved their issue, or adequately addressed their concerns.
  

  

As a customer advocate, you don’t just tweet, you get results. When customers encounter issues in their journey, you work with other teams to address them. Your work and ideas will help us identify root causes so that we can find sustainable solutions. There’s a high level of autonomy — you engage freely on behalf of NYCT — but you must be able to adhere to brand guidelines and protocol. You are also expected to evaluate current practices and recommend strategies and tactics to improve the way we keep customers informed.
  

  

You perform in a high-volume, fast-paced environment and work collaboratively with other teams to ensure communications are timely, accurate, and consistent.

**Responsibilities**  

  

The selected candidate will monitor New York City’s subway and bus services in real-time to determine customer impact, translate internal service change messages into customer facing communications and quickly publish to multiple channels, monitor social chatter, determine the best approach for individual customer queries, and respond accordingly, in plain language (non-jargon) and with a conversational tone. The selected candidate will also escalate urgent issues to operations staff and senior leadership as needed, manage customer queries from start to finish, which may require follow up days later, seek opportunities for improving proactive service communications, brand building, and storytelling for all NYCT services. The selected candidate must be able to and available to work in a 24/7 environment that includes weekdays, overnight shifts, weekends and/or holidays as required.
