A **Unit Manager** is someone who *provides guidance, instruction, direction and* *leadership* *to a group* of other individuals (the team) for the purpose of achieving a key result or group of aligned results. The team leader reports to a manager (overseeing several teams). The team leader monitors the quantitative and qualitative result that is to be achieved.
