**ABOUT THE ROLE**

I am an adult lady living in my own home, in High Peak, Derbyshire. I live with diagnoses of NEAD (Non-epileptic Attack Disorder), Vestibular Disorder, FND (Functional Neurological brain Disorder), Diverticulitis, and Asthma. My diagnoses affect my daily life as I experience regular seizures and absences, mobility difficulties, stomach pains and breathing difficulties. Each of my diagnoses has symptoms which has a knock-on effect on another, and this can lead me to become anxious and low in mood from experiencing symptoms and anticipating the next. I have full capacity and can communicate verbally with staff to direct my own support, at times when I am not having a seizure.

I require support to help me live the life I want to – accessing the community, socialising, going to coffee shops, walking my beloved pet dog – as well as support at home with medications, personal care, mobility, seizure after-care, and keeping my home clean and tidy. Male or female candidates will be considered.

**ABOUT YOU**

I am looking to recruit 2 x staff to work with me during the days, Monday to Saturdays, at times which are flexible to suit my needs.

The ideal candidate will be a driver and have use of their own car (although this is not essential; it is preferred), be flexible, patient, empathetic, have a good sense of humour; I need to be able to trust and feel comfortable with my staff. You will need to speak English fluently so that I can engage in conversation with you. My family and my pet dog are very important to me, so it is important that you are also able to engage with them and have a shared love of animals. You must also be able to demonstrate a high level of professionalism and integrity, promoting my independence and respecting my home.

**BENEFITS**

In return for your dedication, you’ll receive a competitive rate of pay in addition to:

· 5.6 weeks holiday per year (pro-rata for part-time positions).

· Company pension scheme after 3 months’ service, subject to the scheme rules.

· Opportunity to join our Cash Back Health Plan, after successful completion of the probation period.

Are you a caring person? Then a career in Social Care is calling you!

We'd love to invite you to join our excellent team of Professional Careers in your local community. It's a secure, friendly, and enjoyable working environment. You'll get full training, and unlike many careers, you can progress whether you are part-time or full-time.

As a family-made and run business, we understand that flexibility is key! Our team of trained administration professionals will keep your needs in mind.

What's it like being a Carer with us?

Life gets more challenging as we get older, so our Carers are here to provide a helping hand, by visiting people in their own homes, from just a 30-minute call to several visits a day. You might be assisting with fluids and nutrition, shopping, personal care, or just a cup of tea!

Our Carers are friends, allies, and lifelines to people who really need them, sometimes in the final chapters of their lives. There can be sad moments, but here's the thing: you'll have helped. And if our existing carers are to be believed, you'll get a lot out of these relationships too.

Very few jobs have such an impact on people's lives, and being the caring person you are, you're ideally cut out to join us.

We are a Team!

CareYourWay Chester is not just about serving the community; it's about being a team. You'll be working with people like you, who'll be there through the good times and the challenging times.

On joining us, you'll train for the industry-recognised Care Certificate, and you'll shadow experienced colleagues while you learn the ropes. Then there are our branch teams and care

specialists you can call on with any concerns. Additionally, our technology lets you concentrate on care, instead of admin bringing your contact time with your valuable clients longer.

With us, you’ll never feel alone, with our 24/7 on-call system, HR meetings, staff meetings, and regular care plan reviews assuring you that you’re doing things right!

Real-Time Care Tracking

Through our commitment to bringing technology and care together, we are proud to say all our care notes are electronic, including medication, patch notes, and general care notes. If you’re not tech-savvy, don’t worry! Our qualified training team will be there every step of the way to ensure you have full training and feel comfortable before being let loose!

We will applaud your hard work with competitive pay rates and staff benefits. We would like to invite you to join our mission to revolutionise the care sector, where there are genuine promotion prospects to team leader, care specialist, or even move into management.

A few of our Amazing Benefits for You:

· 5.6 weeks per year paid holiday (double pay on Christmas & Boxing Day - time and a half other bank holidays).

· Company Pension.

· This job can be part-time or full-time.

· Your shifts will normally include one weekend every two weeks.

**Where will Next take you?**

Next is one of the UK’s best known retailers on the high-street and most established online. Behind the scenes we are at the cutting edge of Warehousing and Logistics, employing more than 9000 people across our distribution network.

Our success is dependent on the expertise and passion of our teams across the UK. Life as a Loss Prevention Control Room Operative at Next is full of challenges. It’s fast paced and just like fashion trends, is constantly evolving.

Online retail has never been more important than it is now. In these changing and unprecedented times, our operations and the teams within must adapt and grow to ensure that we meet the needs of over 2 million Next customers.

**About the role:**

In this role, you will support the Loss Prevention team in achieving a consistent approach to operate all systems including CCTV, Access Control and to remotely monitor the estate using the technology provided.

Reporting to the Senior Loss Prevention Manager, you will ensure that all information gathered is dealt with in a confidential manner using integrity and accuracy and in accordance with Department/Company GDPR policies.

It is essential that you are a proactive, excellent communicator as you will be in constant contact with the onsite Loss Prevention Management and Officers, Police, other agencies and members of staff. Time Management is key to ensure that the appropriate issues/incidents are reported/escalated and resolved effectively and in a timely manner using the relevant device.

In order to avoid disruption to our services, a key element of this role is to manage the issue of both temporary and permanent access cards to team members, agency staff and contractors. You will be responsible for ensuring that the cards in use are audited and that unauthorised cards are removed from the system in a timely manner.

As a Control Room Operative, you will be required to focus for long periods of time at a desk, closely monitoring the CCTV across multiple sites in order to ensure Next remains a safe and secure place of work.

**About you:**

You will be an excellent communicator and relationship builder, able to work with people at all levels within the business, be proactive in your approach and possess strong analytical skills. You will be able to demonstrate strong technology and computer skills, able to demonstrate proficiency in the use of G-Suite, notably Google Docs and Sheets to report and analyse information

The successful applicant will have previous experience of working within a similar Loss Prevention role or a similar industry would be advantageous.

You will have a flexible approach to working hours and successfully complete a DBS application.
