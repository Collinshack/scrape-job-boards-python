Orion is a 12-year-old boy with a variety of disabilities. His mother is looking for staff to support him at home and in the community (Playa Del Rey area). You will be assisting Orion and his family with daily activities including personal care, hygiene, and household tasks like laundry, meal preparation, cleaning, restocking supplies, etc., and you will also be supporting him in the community by going to fun places, like swimming classes and camp. Any travel and entrance fees you incur will be paid for. His mom is open to hiring people who don’t have experience but are willing to be trained, learn, and love Orion.

Orion has mobility challenges, and needs support with movement. The successful applicant for this position will be able to lift up to 60 pounds, bend, walk, and stand for extended periods of time.

The schedule and hours are set at between 24 and 32 hours per week, though there is some flexibility potentially available. Orion needs support in the afternoons on weekdays (i.e. between 2:00pm and 8:30pm Monday through Thursday and Fridays between 3:00pm and 11:00pm.) Please note that **Saturday & Sunday** availability is required for this position. The occasional overnight shift may also be available, if interested. Orion also attends school via Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), so during school vacations, etc., additional coverage will be needed as well.

*Due to Orion’s disabilities, he receives funding from the Westside Regional Center (https://westsiderc.org/) to meet his needs and for this service and staff. He is part of the Self-Determination Program (https://westsiderc.org/about-the-program/) which is why his family can select their own staff. Specifically, you will be hired by a Financial Management Service (FMS) as a W-2 employee paid hourly at a rate of $25.00 to $28.00 per hour based on performance and depending on experience; payment will be twice per month. You must be able to pass a background check and have a driving record acceptable to the FMS to qualify for this position, as well as reliable transportation to be able to drive Orion as needed. The FMS will be your Employer of Record and who you will report on your taxes.*

Please see below to learn more about Orion and determine if you are the person Orion and his family need!

**ORION IS:**

· Adorable (and he knows it!), with a great laugh. He has incredible positive energy.

· Routine and schedule oriented

· A music lover (including classic rock.) He likes music and singing songs, and he knows his parts. He likes reciprocal play and cause and effect.

· Very physically strong; he likes swimming, jumping on the trampoline, playing catch, and soccer.

· Curious; he loves to learn new things, especially with the right support. He loves activities that are sensory stimulating.

· Energetic, determined, & persistent

· Engaged and present in the current moment, and you should be too! He doesn’t “hold onto” anything negative and he is honest; he is who he is.

**YOU NEED TO:** 

· Be fully vaccinated against COVID-19

· Have your own, reliable, car, a clean driving record, and be able to drive Orion into the community as needed.

· Be fun! Orion is fun and it will be better for both of you if you enjoy being with him.

· Be present with Orion, physically *and* emotionally. Relationships are very important to him, and he needs to trust you. This is not the right job for you if you want to be able to be on your phone, because he needs constant supervision and if you are not providing it, he might get injured.

· Push Orion to be as independent as possible.

· Don’t think of Orion as limited; see Orion’s potential (and he has a lot!)

· Not be afraid of a G-Tube or challenging behaviors, including physical aggression and/or Self-Injurious Behaviors. Orion’s mom and current staff team will train you how to work best with him, redirect him while keeping both him & yourself safe, and to understand his communication.

· Be willing to provide hands-on support with G-Tubes feeding, toileting (changing diapers), personal care, dressing, etc.

· Be organized and prepared for each day

**ORION NEEDS:**

· Constant supervision, especially if he is upset; he has a Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) that limits his ability to see and ambulate, an unsteady gait, and he may display challenging behaviors that could injure him or someone else if he is not redirected.

· Physical, hands-on, assistance with ambulation, personal care, toileting, and eating. His mom and current team will train you on how to work best with him in these areas.

· You to pay attention to his non-verbal communication, such as gestures and sounds, but to communicate with *him* verbally and consistently, because he can’t see you nodding, shaking your head, etc.

· To do things himself as much as possible; it doesn’t help him if you do it *for* him, but rather show *him* how to do it.

· To follow a routine.
