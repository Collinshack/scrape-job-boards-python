* **Employee discounts.**

**WHO WE'RE SEEKING:**  

*For general descriptive purposes only, as actual job duties may vary and are subject to change due to changing business or patient needs, and may include other duties as needed:** Full-time and part-time possibilities.
* Experience in a kennel, animal boarding/daycare facility, or veterinary environment is preferred, but not required.
* As a key player in ensuring animals are fed and cared for, Kennel Assistants directly contribute to the health, hygiene, and well-being of patients. Since patients rely on Kennel Assistants to attend to their essential needs, punctuality and reliability are essential.
* Kennel Assistant serves as a second set of eyes for the Veterinarians and other staff. Emerging concerns regarding a patient's health may be noticed first by the Kennel Assistant. Accordingly, Kennel Assistants must have a keen detail orientation, work well both independently and under guidance, and demonstrate initiative in completing daily tasks. Following through on detailed instructions is essential.
* Daily tasks include feeding animals; cleaning kennels and habitats; kennel laundry; bathing and grooming dogs and cats; administering medications (including via subcutaneous injection after training); walking and observing dogs outdoors; cleaning cat litter; transporting animals to and from kennels, exam rooms, the lobby, and clients' vehicles; sanitation and janitorial duties throughout the facility, including sweeping, mopping, trash removal, organizing, and general cleaning; observing patients for signs of discomfort or medical concern; frequently documenting observations and work performed in electronic medical records software; immediately informing Veterinarians of suspected medical concerns; etc.
* Being on our team is fun and rewarding, but requires being a go-getter with tactful client communication skills and high respect for patients, clients, and fellow team members. We value a positive attitude, collaborative spirit, and impeccable ethics. And of course, a love for animals and veterinary medicine is essential!
